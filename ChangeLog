2003-12-29  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@cs.uku.fi>

2003-12-13  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@cs.uku.fi>

        * the ~#NC display code caused the reading of a text file

          library path for doors even when they are invoked from
          a DayDream process invoked from the FTP daemon. Read
          'docs/UPDATING' for more information.

	* door programs could hang the board if they did not

        * uploaded files with no file_id.diz are no longer
          deleted when using 'site upload' feature on ftp.

        * date extraction from file_id.diz files somehow

          execute programs with different UID or GID.

          as an alternative for missing one. In other
          words, libutil is not needed on Linux anymore.

        * replaced the old telnet daemon with the one
          checked out from OpenBSD-current CVS tree. 
          It has been modified to negotiate the binary
          transmission mode and to warn on failure.  

2001-07-11  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

        * message reading command 'keep' was broken.

          control-C and such key combinations work and it 
          does not die on OpenBSD anymore.

          Read "docs/HOWTO-ftp" for further information.

          fault on FreeBSD in stats screen. You should read

 	  direct accesses to the userbase file from the rest of code.

1999-12-19  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

	* fixed the initial strings in ddcallers' slots.

	* fixed a bug in ddcallers that caused the yesterday's statistics
	  to accumulate into today's statistics.

	* fixed the option `-e' (exclude sysop) in ddcallers.	

1999-12-04  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

	* view-command works again.

	* getdd.py gets installed if Python support is compiled.

	* fixed broken Python support.

1999-12-01  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

	* traced down many memory leaks in menus.c, typetext.c and
	  display.c.

	* fixed a bug in the menu code, pop_menu was still broken.

	* added ddfv to the supplied "daydream.cfg".

1999-11-29  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

	* wrote HOWTO-telnet.

	* wrote spec-file for RPM packaging.

	* compile with -D_GNU_SOURCE to include the declaration of getpt(). 

1999-11-24  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

	* getpty() supports Unix98 pty's as well.

1999-11-09  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

	* when creating a doorport, malfunctioning doors that continued
	  to run even if socket binding failed were not killed properly.

1999-11-03  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

	* the doorport is now re-entrant, so invoking a door within
	  a running door does not cause lock-ups.

1999-11-02  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

	* dumped 'mklinks', 'make install' does the job now. Old links
	  are removed befored creating symlinks. No unnecessary links
	  are made.

	* changed the maximum number of fileareas per conference back
	  to 256, since some old binary-only doors (e.g. saturnjoin) 
	  didn't like the changed field size.

1999-10-31  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

	* modified the menu code a bit; default menu bindings are provided
	  by the program, instead of forcing the user to supply them. Thus,
	  one doesn't need to know about the new menu system at all.

1999-09-26  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

	* symlinks are created by 'mklinks'. Symlinks and ownerships should
	  be set correctly now.

	* some weird segfaults found in usered and filelist under FreeBSD.
	  They are fixed now, but I don't know the real reason behind them.

1999-09-25  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

	* FreeBSD support reincarnated.

1999-09-23  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

	* pop_menu-command was broken.

	* better fix for argument passing in the menu code.

1999-09-21  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

	* autojoinconf-feature was completely broken.

	* menu commands "internal" and "door" pass the command
	  arguments correctly; userlist was broken because of this.

1999-09-20  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

	* 'make new-board' works ok for different source & compile paths.

	* ddcfg creates all directories correctly now.

1999-09-19  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

	* "command" didn't pass the arguments correctly.

	* command redefinition didn't work in the menu code.

	* added support for multiple concurrent compiles.

1999-08-08  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

	* TypeFile(): TYPE_SEC flag wasn't handled correctly, namely it
	  attempted to print the file without security extension first.
	 
	* TypeFile() and friends: cleaned and generalized a bit. The
	  filename tokens are handled here, not in menus.c (they
	  appeared originally there).

1999-08-01  Hannu Lyytinen  <hlyytine@masto.uku.fi>

	* Started this ChangeLog.

	* Converted the whole package to use Automake.

	* Python module is now called `libddpython.so', not `_dd.so'.
