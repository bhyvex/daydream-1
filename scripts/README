This directory contains some perl/python/sh/whatever scripts.

Feel free to contibute if you have written something useful.

Following scripts are available:

longtoshort.pl - converts lists with long filenames to short format

desc.pl        - converts descript.ion to long daydream filelist.
                 stdin: descript.ion, stdout: dd filelist. Run in the
		 directory where the files are.
		 (This isn't 100% but it works for most of the case :)
		 
clean.pl       - cleans up the file list, i.e. strips the unnecessary
                 descriptions from packages containing multiple packets,
		 leaving the description in the last packet only. Overall
		 layout is unchanged.
		 
cfg2dbinds     - a shell script that extracts the doors from daydream.cfg
                 and writes the menu command bindings for them to standard
		 output.
