How to report bugs
==================

Simply put, a bug report has to reveal what's going wrong. If it's a
build error, either the compiler error log or `config.log' helps a lot.
In case of run-time bug or erroneous behaviour, try to be descriptive
and explicitly state why do you think something is wrong. Suggestions
are more than welcome.

It can not be stressed enough that whenever you report a bug, do have
a valid return address in your email. Sometimes 'bugs' are just about
misunderstanding the documentation and could be easily 'fixed' if you
only had a valid return address.

These are mandatory:

 - GNU C compiler
 - GNU C++ compiler

The requirements listed below are not mandatory, but the respective
