2.14.6
~~~~~~

 - Sometimes file_id.diz files were not extracted correctly. 

 - Previously files not passing background checker were deleted
   on FTP sessions. Now they remain to be uploaded whenever the
   user logs in via telnet.

 - Now running on Solaris.

2.14.5
~~~~~~

 - Wrote workaround for using the FTP server behind a NAT.

2.14.4
~~~~~~
 - ddwho and ddftpwho working for non-bbs UNIX users.

 - Fixed a symlink vulnerability in the upload checker.

 - ddtelnetd and ddftpd are now statically linked to auxiliary 
   libraries. This improves security and makes it unnecessary to
   relink the binaries when moving them around the file system.

 - Operating system banner removed from ddtelnetd.

 - Amiga telnet clients can connect at last.

 - Aesthetics improved by fixing the length computation of strings
   containing ANSI control codes.

   console".

 - Tosser did not mark processed messages as tossed.

2.14.3
~~~~~~
 - A login script for DayDream is generated automatically
   during installation. 

 - Implemented archive checking more securely and improved
   overall secureness as well.

 - Text search worked only in the current message base.

 - Some messages could be "lost" due to typo in the message
   reading code.

 - Door testing command "$" is now restricted to SysOp only.

 - The password prompt for a door was displayed even if
   the door had not a password.

2.14.2
~~~~~~
 - The feature of preventing multiple logins was broken.

 - Text file control codes ~#MC, ~#TF and ~#RA were vulnerable
   to a buffer overflow attack.
 
 - Fixed a typo that slipped into tosser's sources.

2.14.1
~~~~~~
 - Eliminated the need of mounted /proc in ddftpwho, ddftpd, 
   server and yelld.

 - Removed deprecated entries CHATCMD, CHATMODE, DISABLEWILDS,
   QUESTIONS, QUICKLINEED, ARC_TYPE and ARC_OFFLINE from
   'daydream.cfg', since they were historical and did not
   affect anything.

 - Fixed tosser's broken outbound mail handler.

2.14
~~~~
 - The '\s' token can be used in strings.xxx to omit the rest
   of the line, even newline characters.

 - Login procedure can be configured to query the password
   even if the user account does not exist.

 - Disabling new account creation is now possible.

 - Added password support for door invocation. This can be
   used to restrict the shell access, for example. 

 - Missing text files are syslogged on local2.debug.

 - Query about the number of incoming/outgoing conversion table
   can be now configured out of login.

 - Fixed the bugging catalog-based dupechecker. It searched 
   only the first conference for duplicate files.

 - Apparently ddftpd uploaded to user's last joined conference
   if the 'SITE UPLOAD' command was not given. Fixed.

 - Fixed python-specific compilation errors.

 - Job control works now in spawned processes that
   communicate with DayDream by means of standard I/O.

 - Added a possibility to specify the installation path
   of DayDream for the FTP daemon. Read "docs/HOWTO-ftp".

 - Fixed a printf() format bug in the stats screen that
   resulted in segmentation fault every time on FreeBSD.
   Read "docs/UPDATING". 

 - Fixed problems in PTY allocation.

 - Fixed ddsnoop, which did not work on BSD systems.

 - Plugged up two file descriptor leaks.

 - Fixed the permission problem in ddcfg again. 

 - Telnet nodes work again on OpenBSD. Fixed by Jann Fischer.

 - Removed the necessity of a mounted /proc, thus eliminating
   potential security hazards on OpenBSD.

 - Fixed a few buffer overrun bugs, which could have caused
   very weird behavior, including (but not limited to) random
   characters on screen and segmentation faults. 

2.13
~~~~
 - Minor fix to ddcfg. Apparently it created all the 
   configuration files with wrong permissions.

 - Usered and sysop login work now correctly in the built-in
   frontdoor.

 - Both local and telnet connections work now on both NetBSD
   and OpenBSD.

 - Fixed ddtelnetd compiling problems on OpenBSD.

   appear slowly on local nodes (e.g. 'shell' didn't
   work correctly).

 - DayDream did not hung up the user's line on daily time limit.

2.11
~~~~
 - Fixed a logical bug that caused locked up nodes to ignite
   a chain reaction. 

 - Fixed a possibly exploitable buffer overflow bug in 
   strspa(). 

 - Runs on NetBSD and OpenBSD, too.

 - A typo in "configure" prevented ddftpd to be compiled.

 - New users are now allowed to join conference #1 by default.

 - DayDream segfaulted after upload. This buffer overflow bug 
   has been fixed.

 - Userbase code rewritten in an effort to get it bugless.

 - Door parameter tokens documented.
 
 - The command like tokens for DDDI doors in daydream.cfg are
   now applicable to stdio programs.

 - The output of quickly terminating stdio programs was not
   shown correctly.

 - Socket descriptor leak in the doorport fixed.

 - Node messages (login/logout notifications, OLMS) do not cause
   random jams anymore.

 - Fixed the telnetd segmentation faults.

 - Added support for the syslogd(8) facility.

2.10
~~~~
 - Python support is fixed.

 - Y2K problems fixed, read docs/README.y2k.

 - Fixed the totally broken view-command.

 - Cosmetic bugs in ddcallers fixed.

 - ddcallers updates yesterday's statistics correctly.

 - Fixed the "-e" option in ddcallers (exclude SysOp).

 - The changes in user's access to conferences go into effect
   even if the user is online currently.

 - One couldn't write a message to a user in a conference, into
   which the user has just been granted access to.

 - Local and SysOp logins from the built-in frontdoor were not
   provided the default menu bindings. Fixed.

 - This kind of logins also caused immediate segmentation faults.

 - Serial TTY is opened in non-blocking mode first in order to
   avoid mysterious jams.

 - Fixed a bug that caused only the *.gfx files be shown, not *.txt.

 - Fixed the source code to compile with glibc 2.0.

 - Found a segmentation fault in the menu code.

 - Text files were shown without any pause.
 
 - Implemented the missing "log"-command as a door.
 
 - Coded the "$"-command for testing doors.

 - Fixed installation problems on FreeBSD. 

2.09
~~~~
 - "ddfv" is included in the default configuration file.

 - pop_menu-command fixed.

 - Many memory leaks cured.

 - DayDream is now available also in RPM packages.

 - Wrote a small HOWTO-telnet.

 - Unix98 PTY support added (e.g. /dev/pts/*).

 - Doors that failed to bind the socket but continued to run
   effectively jammed the system. Fixed.

 - Made doorport re-entrant. Doors invoking another doors will
   not get stuck anymore.
 
 - Brought back the limit of 256 fileareas per conference, since
   some binary-only doors (e.g. SaturnJoin) did not like the change.

 - Hopefully fixed symlinking stuff during the installation phase.

 - Default menu bindings are provided by DayDream. On other words,
   it works like the version 2.06 if you do not redefine menus.

2.08
~~~~
 - You can build DayDream in any directory and leave the source tree
   untouched. This is useful for development and/or cross platform
   compiling purposes.

 - Menu command "command" (executes a menu command, just like if the
   user had typed it) did not pass its arguments. For example, "j 5"
   was interpreted as "j".

 - One could not override commands already defined in the same menu
   context.

 - As the installer does not create necessary paths any longer, ddcfg
   is modified to create all the directories correctly.

 - Autojoinconf-feature was broken, namely the user joined the last
   accessible conference during mail/file scan if the conference he or
   she was joined in before the latest logoff and the autojoin-conference
   was not accessible.

 - Menu commands "internal" and "door" interpret an empty string as
   NULL string now. Previously they were interpreted just as a 
   zero-length string; for example, userlist was broken because of
   this bug.

 - Menu command "pop_menu" was broken, segfaulting and other issues.

 - Support for FreeBSD is back. It segfaulted a lot at first, but I hope
   most of these bugs are cured now.

2.07
~~~~
 - Somehow managed to break socket stuff in 2.06, olms did not work.

 - Added support for dynamically loadable modules. The code is there, but
   it is not used by default. Perhaps some day I'll do something with this.

 - Some typos in documentation corrected. 

 - The tilde character (~) in the modem configuration file caused a pause
   of 50 milliseconds, not half a second as claimed. Fixed.

 - Conferences with no messagebases do not cause problems anymore.

 - `<' command didn't show a list of conferences to join like `>' did.

 - Door-port had a bug; whenever exec() failed (door executable existed but
   had not exec-bit set), DayDream waited for door to respond forever.

 - The number of file areas per conference is now unlimited (more
   correctly, currently the maximum is 999 but it's only a matter of
   pathnames and some aesthetical things).

 - Added `text search' command.
 
 - Implemented a soft-coded menu system, including support for hotkeys
   and multiple menus.

2.06
~~~~
 - telnetd, ddftpd and hydracom now compile on a Linux box without any
   difficulties (obsolete?).

 - Lack of the string definition file of requsted display mode won't
   crash DD anymore.

 - The string definition file format is now more liberal. Comments
   can be added, too.
   
 - Deleted users' ghosts don't appear any longer in usered.

 - Usered users can't delete theirselves.
 
 - Main menu prompt now complains about unknown command. It also ignores
   leftmost whitespaces like the real shells do.

 - PCBoardish repeat kicker added (try holding "enter" in the main menu).
   
 - DDDI has now a function to disable output to local/remote side.

 - DayDream comes now with DDFV.

 - A new ftp-daemon has been written. You'll need ProFTPD, which is 
   located at http://www.proftpd.org/.

 - DD won't get stuck on carrier loss due to door programs not honoring
   the timeout anymore.

 - Wrote a filelist cleaner in Perl. Check scripts/clean.pl and README.

 - ddrz/ddsz couldn't be compiled with glibc 2.1. Fixed.

2.05
~~~~
 - Found a serious security hole in message base. Fixed. 

 - Daydream now hides the password input and asks it twice when chanhing it.

 - flagsingle() was broken. It was totally case-sensitive.

 - Grab produced broken index-files. Fixed. Also Grab takes now commandline
   parameters (GRAB D works from main menu).

 - Added alarm-routine for doorport startup. If the door refuses to work,
   DD doesn't die, but exists the door port after 3 seconds of silence.

 - Added python a python module for easier door/add-on/script writing.
   RTFM for more info.

 - Grab door was SERIOUSLY broken. It didn't close the files (!!) it put
   to the message packet.

 - Added direct FTP-support.
 
2.04
~~~~
 - Made DD able to answer phone calls. (No need for getty anymore).
 
 - Fixed a bug in tosser which caused long messages to be splitted and not
   imported fully.
   
 - Added ability to run multiple doors at once.
 
 - Added view and fake to "new" -door.
 
 - Made DD to inform other nodes when someone logged on.
 
 - Upload doesn't wrap too long lines anymore.
 
 - Added catalog search for duplicate files. DD checks for logfiles if
   file has been previously uploaded (optional). READ docs/UPDATING NOW!
   This will work incorrectly if sick things have happened to uploadlog.dat.
      
 - Made ddcallers able to handle connections faster than 57600.
 
 - Hopefully fixed a bug in telnetd which caused it to jam sometimes in
   the beginning of connection.
   
 - Fixed a stupid bug which caused doors to exit when DD received socket
   message.
   
 - Some ~# -codes were not working. Fixed.
 
 - Added user configurable option for maximum number of description lines
   to be shown on filelistings. (Edit user, option 11.)

 - Added "rz" command to main menu, to make automatic zmodem uploading
   in main menu to work.
   
 - Made OLM handling a bit more intellingent.
 
 - Added possibility to change the order of control codes in main prompt.
   See docs for the control codes.
   
 - Added k)eep to read message commands.
   
 - Implemented ftp-daemon for DD. Read ddftp/README for more info.
 
 - Implemented background checker. Background checker checks files while user
   is uploading them, and if they contain file_id.diz, DD puts them online.
   This one is really neat :)

 - Because of strace bugs and zombie-killing-techniques of DD, strace doesn't
   work with DD anymore. I hope future versions of strace will work with DD
   also. This REALLY makes the debugging harder. (Actually i have a patched
   strace myself and I have whined strace author about the bug).
   
 - Added some dd_getintval()'s to libdd. Hello to karnivaalikeksi.
 
 - Fixed a small outlookbug in faker.

 - Fully made DD fts.009 compliant (REPLY-kludge works now :)

 - Zmodem download didn't work properly in carrier loss -situations. Fixed.
 
 - Added "link"-command. It uses the same routines with "move", so don't
   be scared if DD tells you that "moving" file :). Link copies filelist entry
   to destination conference and creates a symlink.

 - Added "copy"-command. Works like "link" but instead of linking, it creates
   a copy.

 - mmap() handling was broken in zmodem. ddsz ate LOTS of memory on big
   patches. (The bug remains in lsz). I just disabled mmap() and made ddsz
   to use fread() to read data. That sucks, but works.
   (My record: ddsz eating *120* megs of memory. NEAT! I won pine :Q) 

 - Fixed a bug in global message read which caused it to loop forever
   sometimes.

 - Added support for multiple upload paths. Instead of upload path, you can
   specify list of upload paths. See docs for more info.

 - Fixed a stupid security bug (If new user replaced a deleted user, he got
   the security level of the deleted user).

 - NEW and DD's internal filelisters show now if the file is flagged.

 - Made DD able to remember flagged files after carrier loss.

 - "<" didn't ask conference password if there was one. 
   This was one of the MANY bugs dalamar found :)
   
 - Made it possible to disable global dupechecking on a conference... 

 - Fixed a stupid bug. New users were not logged correctly. (Caused some
   bugging in last callers).

 - Playing with tageditor allowed user to leech more than he had time to.
   Fixed.

 - Made DD able to handle partitions larger than 4GB.

 - Made DD to compile on glibc. 

 - Server didn't remove zombies -> caused Open View to work only at once etc.

 - UserEd had limit of 10 gigs for ul/dl bytes. Removed.

 - Added "msgbaseopt"-utility for maintaining msgbases. It deletes deleted 
   messages, recycles the messages and fixes message pointers. (LRPs too).

 - Added support for faker to fake flagged files.
 
 - Added some door commands.

 - Some file_id.dizes didn't get imported correctly, because they we're sick.
   Hello DRINK OR DIE, CR comes before LF in MS-dos, real OS'es don't use
   CR at all.

 - Default archive corrupt strings were somewhat incorrect. Fixed.

 - N/F/Z and NEW/FR inform user what went from if she was unable to flag
   a file.

 - Make daydream, doors and utils to compile on -Wall. I hope this will
   add stability, reduce mem usage etc... At least I found a few bugs
   while cleaning the source tree up :)

 - Added -s commandline parameter, to make it possible to invoke DD from
   binkley term or already open connection.

 - When user uploads or downloads file with ZModem, name of the file and
   current CPS rate are informed in "WHO" command.

 - Made DD to kick user out if he couldn't enter his name on 10 attempts.

 - DD asks now after replying a private message successfully if user wants
   to delete the original message. This way we can save some HD space (like
   it would cost something these days).

 - Added "ddftpwho" utility, to view who's currently using ftp.

 - Conftop didn't work correctly if user had uploaded more than 4 gigs. Fixed.

 - DD counted free flagged files incorrectly. Fixed.
 
 - Added some statistic output after upload.

 - Config program is now a bit more intelligent. Order of fields is now longer
   necessary and you can have comments inside "blocks".

 - Fixed a bug in Movefile which caused it to seg fault when moving files
   from 8+3 conf to a conf that is using long filenames. If it still seg
   faults, then it's a libc-bug and should be fixed at least when GLibc
   becomes the standard.

 - Added a new util to utils/ dir. "logrot" rotates the binary logfiles.
   It deletes the oldest fieds from the binary logs, and if the log file is
   corrupted somehow, it fixes it (mostly).

 - Security bit for olm was broken.
 
 - DDTop didn't show new users in weektop. Fixed.
 
2.03
~~~~

 - Main menu is being looked from conferences display directory too.

 - DayDream showed wrong conferencepw -text file if confpw was activated.

 - Added WHOF-door (shows who transferred a file).

 - N T U works now (hi Agony :)

 - Tosser should act faster now.

 - Added wildcards for Faker.

 - Some doors jammed if carrier was lost. Fixed.

 - DD dumped core if some strings we're too long. (Still dumps, but not that
   easily :)

 - Server ate too much CPU and X bandwidth. Fixed.

 - Made pcb2ansi-util, to convert @X<blabla> to ansi.

 - Fixed a small bug in fsed (didn't allow to kill the first line)

 - DayDream takes the local screen length from KERNEL, not from config :)

 - There's now daydream mailing list. Send a message to 
   daydream-request@coyote.eu.org with text "subscribe daydream" in the
   message body to subscribe list. Messages posted to
   daydream@coyote.eu.org will be mailed to the subscribers.

 - Made it possible to deny multiple connections, so a user can't be online
   more than once. 

 - Made it possible to adjust new user defaults. (switches)

 - Changed login a bit. If user record is not found, DD asks if user want to
   register as a new user. (Configurable)

 - Added UPDATING textfile in dosc/ dir. READ IT!!!!!!!!!
 
 - Multiple SIGHUP's should not kill daydream anymore. (Hi crocodile :)

 - DD doesn't wrap long lines in local messages anymore. Only echos will
   be wrapped.

 - Added dd_changestatus() to every included door so server and other
   users are able to see WHAT door user is running :)

 - File listers had a buffer flow sometimes. Fixed.

 - Added command line parameters for DayDream executable. DD recognizes
   -d (disable idle) and -l (local logon). -l can be used if you like to
   logon to the board from shell without rlogin or telnet.


2.02
~~~~

 - Added a nice x11-based control panel. NOTE! It requires EZWGL 1.2, which
   is not released yet :)) Take a look at my webpage (www.vaala.fi/~hydra)
   for the binary.

 - Fixed a bug with chat reason.

 - Added signal handling for DDSnoop.

 - Made some minor changes with terminal initializations.

 - Cleaned the source code up. Made it more portable and stuff.. :)

 - Added ctrl-c support for "new"-door.

 - N/F/Z and NEW are able to unflag a file if it's already flagged. 
   (Flag == toggle)

 - Made FSEd to bug a little less :)

 - Added command line history to the main menu.

 - Made cursor file flagging a bit more incasesensitive.

 - Improved (?) the message quoting system a bit. Also fixed a few bugs
   in it.

   

2.01
~~~~

 - Fixed a bug in TypeFile(). Random files were not shown correctly.

 - I managed to totally f*ck up logging facilities of ddsz/ddrz.
   Fixed :)

 - Outgoing character conversion did NOT work properly. Fixed.

 - Added possibility to replace a string in strings.xxx with a textfile.
