README for running DayDream on Solaris
======================================

  Tested only on the SPARC platform.


1. printf() formatting code issue
---------------------------------

  The default "strings.001" contains BSDish printf() format codes
  which are not supported in Solaris. On the other hand, the
  corresponding Solaris formatting codes are not supported in
  older BSD systems. 

  This will be fixed in the future. Meanwhile, you should replace
  three strings in "strings.001" or you will experience segmentation
  fault. The particular formatting code is "%qu", which is dubbed
  "%llu" in Solaris. So, change these lines:

freespacestr:\n[36mFree uploading space: %qu bytes (%qu bytes at once!)\n\n
stats6str:[32mUploads      [33m: [0m%11.11qu [32mBytes <[33m*[32m> [0m%10.10hu [32mFiles[0m ([32mFile Ratio [36mUL[0m:[36m%s[0m)\n
stats7str:[32mDownloads    [33m: [0m%11.11qu [32mBytes <[33m*[32m> [0m%10.10hu [32mFiles[0m ([32mByte Ratio [36mUL[0m:[36m%s[0m)\n\n

  After replacing "%qu" with "%llu" the lines should be as follows: 

freespacestr:\n[36mFree uploading space: %qu bytes (%qu bytes at once!)\n\n
stats6str:[32mUploads      [33m: [0m%11.11qu [32mBytes <[33m*[32m> [0m%10.10hu [32mFiles[0m ([32mFile Ratio [36mUL[0m:[36m%s[0m)\n
stats7str:[32mDownloads    [33m: [0m%11.11qu [32mBytes <[33m*[32m> [0m%10.10hu [32mFiles[0m ([32mByte Ratio [36mUL[0m:[36m%s[0m)\n\n


2. runtime linker path issues
-----------------------------

  You might notice that some doors fail to start, outputting only
  an error message like this:

ld.so.1: bin/faker: fatal: libgcc_s.so.1: open failed: No such file or directory

  This message means that the door program was linked against some
  library which is not in the runtime linker default search path.
  First, you need to find this library. After you know its location,
  you can either add the directory to the environment variable 
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in "/home/bbs/ddlogin" or you can modify the
  system-wide search path by issuing the following command as root:

crle -l /usr/lib -i /usr/lib -l /usr/local/lib -i /usr/local/lib

  where /usr/local/lib was the location of libgcc_s.so.1. Always 
  include /usr/lib in the search path or your system will not work.
  If you mess up the search path, you can just reset as follows:

crle -l /usr/lib -i /usr/lib
