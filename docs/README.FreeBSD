README for running DayDream on FreeBSD
======================================

  Tested only on the i386 platform.

  Automake uses some GNU make specific constructs, so you have 
  to install 'gmake' first and substitute 'gmake' for 'make' in
  the general installation instructions.

  Furthermore, you must change some lines in daydream.cfg. 
    
LOCALNODEPAT. /dev/tty* 

  must be changed to

LOCALNODEPAT. /dev/ttyv* 
 
  On FreeBSD, the appropriate serial ports are called /dev/cuaaX.
