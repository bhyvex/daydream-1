This is a simple guide on how to create a telnet-board using DayDream.
All pathnames are for Red Hat Linux, yours may vary.

 1) Compile and install DayDream.

 2) Assign a port for your board by adding the following line to
    "/etc/services":
    
daydream 7000/tcp

    Choose any port that suits your preferences.
    
 3) Make sure you are running "inetd". It should invoke DayDream's
    telnetd (it is hardwired for 8 bits only, as opposed to standard
    telnet daemon) and it is accomplished by editing "/etc/inetd.conf".
    Insert the following line into it:
    
daydream stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /home/bbs/sbin/ddtelnetd \
-L /home/bbs/.kickstart

    Note that this is a single line and the backslash at the end of the 
    first line just denotes continuation. Also note that "/usr/sbin/tcpd"
    is a wrapper from package "tcp_wrappers". If you do not have this 
    package, use the line below:

daydream stream tcp nowait root /home/bbs/sbin/ddtelnetd ddtelnetd \
-L /home/bbs/.kickstart
    
 4) Having done that, "ddtelnetd" runs "/home/bbs/.kickstart" as a login
    program. We will just login as "bbs" there:
    
#!/bin/sh
exec login bbs

    Do not forget to do "chmod u+rx /home/bbs/.kickstart". 
    
 5) Now you will have to invoke DayDream as a part of bbs's login
    procedure. Furthermore, one needs to logout after exiting 
    DayDream. This is accomplished by adding the following lines 
    to "home/bbs/.bash_profile" (this is for bash):
    
daydream
logout
    
    Note that you should export LD_LIBRARY_PATH, as described in the
    basic installation instructions.
  
 6) You may want to get rid of the UNIX password in bbs's login
    procedure. passwd(1) programs shipped with decent Red Hats have
    the -d switch.
    
passwd -d bbs 
  
 7) Have the "inetd" to reread its configuration file:
 
kill -s SIGHUP `/sbin/pidof inetd`

 8) Enjoy.
