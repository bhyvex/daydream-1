DayDream FAQ
------------

Q: I can upload files ok, but downloading doesn't work at all?
A: [conf]/data/paths.dat is missing. That file is for list of download
   paths. Add one path per line and it works.

Q: Uploads seem to disappear. What's wrong?
A: Upload directory has incorrect permissions.

Q: My telnet users complain that zmodem doesn't work. What's wrong?
A: Unix telnetd is in 7-bit mode as default. Your users need to configure
   their telnet-clients correctly.

Q: I want to skip that "login: bbs" stuff. How do I do that?
A: Make a new port for daydream. Use telnetd for that port, but add 
   -L parameter to run a script that does "exec login bbs".

Q: I can't compile python!
A: Get python .rpm from ftp.python.org and install it. Then edit 
   /usr/src/daydream/python/Makefile and make PYTHONDIR and PYTHONMODS
   point to the right directory.

Q: Why all these 'bin' and 'sbin' directories and symlinks?
A: As DayDream is to be GNUificated, I am going to comply with the
   Linux FileSystem Standard. 

Q: Why 'automake'?
A: Having added 'configure', 'automake' and 'libtool' provide an easy
   way to deal with libraries and installation process. 

Q: Why 'GNU'?
A: The GNU General Public License gives persons and groups interested
   in modding (modification of existing software) relatively free hands.
   It also helps the central development team and modding groups work
   together, as the legal details are clear.
   
Q: Characters with the highest bit set (i.e. IBMPC ROM font) do not
   appear correctly on local nodes.
A: You have toggle the alternate character set on. This is done by
   outputting the ^[[11m ANSI sequence to the console on most Unix
   flavors on PC and it is supported by the de-facto standard ANSI.SYS
   on MSDOS, so you can add this string to banner.[gfx/txt].
   Please note that your console appears as an ordinary MSDOS "console"
   and you have to select IBM translation in login screen. Since MSDOS
   conventions differ a lot from the Unix console, you may want to turn 
   the ACS off by outputting ^[[10m to the console.

Q: How can I run dosdoors via daydream?
A: Read docs/HOWTO-dosdoor
