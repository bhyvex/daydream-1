Instructions for inetd-based systems (using the default port 21)
----------------------------------------------------------------

 1) Compile and install DayDream.

 2) Insert the following line into your "inetd.conf":

ftp stream tcp nowait root /home/bbs/sbin/ddftpd ddftpd -D/home/bbs -p/home/bbs/bin/daydream

 3) Use "kill" command to signal inetd to reread its configuration file:
    
kill -HUP <inetd's PID>
   


Instructions for inetd-based systems (using another port)
---------------------------------------------------------

 1) Compile and install DayDream.

 2) Add the following line to "/etc/services":

ddftp 7001/tcp

    You can use any port number you wish, just make sure it is
    not already used.

 3) Insert the following line to your "inetd.conf":

ddftp stream tcp nowait root /home/bbs/sbin/ddftpd ddftpd -D/home/bbs -p/home/bbs/bin/daydream
  
 4) Use "kill" command to signal inetd to reread its configuration file:
    
kill -HUP <inetd's PID>



Instructions for xinetd-based systems (using the default port 21)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 1) Compile and install DayDream.

 2) Create a file "/etc/xinetd.d/ddftpd" or wherever the configuration
    files of xinetd are stored on your system:

service ftp
{
	socket_type		= stream
	wait			= no
	user			= root
	server			= /home/bbs/sbin/ddftpd
	server_args		= -D/home/bbs -p/home/bbs/bin/daydream
	log_on_success		+= DURATION
	nice			= 10
	disable			= no
}

 3) Do "/etc/init.d/xinetd restart".



Instructions for xinetd-based systems (using another port)
----------------------------------------------------------

 1) Compile and install DayDream.

 2) Add the following line to "/etc/services":

ddftp 7001/tcp

    You can use any port number you wish, just make sure it is
    not already used.

 3) Create a file "/etc/xinetd.d/ddftpd" or wherever the configuration
    files of xinetd are stored on your system:

service ddftp
{
	socket_type		= stream
	wait			= no
	user			= root
	server			= /home/bbs/sbin/ddftpd
	server_args		= -D/home/bbs -p/home/bbs/bin/daydream
	log_on_success		+= DURATION
	nice			= 10
	disable			= no
}

 4) Do "/etc/init.d/xinetd restart".



Using DayDream FTP server behind a NAT
--------------------------------------

 The FTP server has an optional switch -P to force another IP into
 a PASV reply. Just use the IP of the machine performing NAT. For
 example, let's assume "inetd.conf" has the following line:

ftp stream tcp nowait root /home/bbs/sbin/ddftpd ddftpd -D/home/bbs -p/home/bbs/bin/daydream -P136.0.83.1

 Let's see how the server responds to a request for passive mode: 

$ telnet 127.0.0.1 21
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to 127.0.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
