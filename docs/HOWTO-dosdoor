This is a simple guide on how to get DOS door games running using 
DayDream 2.11.

This has only been tested on Slackware Linux 7.0, your mileage may vary.

  1) Apply daydream-2.11-dosdoor.patch [Might not be necessary with newer
     versions]

darkstar:/bbs$ patch -p0 < daydream-2.11-dosdoor.patch

  2) Get dosemu 1.0.1 and the vmodem patch

dosemu 1.0.1: ftp://ftp.dosemu.org/dosemu/dosemu-1.0.1.tgz
vmodem patch: ftp://ftp.dosemu.org/dosemu/fixes/patch-1.0.1-missing-vmodem.gz

  3) Extract dosemu, patch in vmodem

  6) Install dosemu, with a bootdir

  7) Set up your doors via dosemu, then in /etc/dosemu.conf set com1 to
     "virtual".
     NOTE: Your doors should expect either a dorinfo%n.def or door.sys
     file in the directory they are installed in.

  8) Modify this file as suited for each door and place in the directory
     where the dropfile will go.

     This one is for BRE and is called "start-bre"

-----------
#!/bin/bash

DOORDIR='C:\\bre\\'
AUTOEXEC='autoexec.one'
BOOTDIR='/bbs/c-drive'
STARTBAT='start.bat'

trap '' 2 3

/bin/cp -f $BOOTDIR/$AUTOEXEC $BOOTDIR/autoexec.N$1

echo -e 'cd ' $DOORDIR ' \r' >> $BOOTDIR/autoexec.N$1
echo -e 'call ' $STARTBAT ' '$1' \r' >> $BOOTDIR/autoexec.N$1
echo -e 'exitemu \r' >> $BOOTDIR/autoexec.N$1
reset > /dev/null
nice -n 10 /usr/bin/dos -C -D-a -I "video { none } emubat N$1"
rm $BOOTDIR/autoexec.N$1
-----------

     Here is the contents of "start.bat" in "C:\bre" [Lines terminated
     CRLF!!!]

-----------
srdoor.exe
bre.exe
-----------

     This start file can handle multiple nodes. If your door requires
     the node number on the command line, use %1 in the start.bat file
     where it is necessary.

  9) Next, add your door to daydream.cfg
     Use a doortype of 7 if the door expects a dorinfo%n.def file,
     or 8 if the door expects door.sys

     Here is an example for BRE with a door.sys dropfile

-----------
DOOR_COMMAND.. BRE
DOOR_TYPE..... 8
DOOR_SECURITY. 5
DOOR_EXECUTE.. /bbs/c-drive/bre/start-bre
DOOR_CONFS1... XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
DOOR_CONFS2... XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
-----------

      DayDream will automatically supply start-bre with the node, so you
      don't have to.
      DayDream will drop the door.sys file as /bbs/c-drive/bre/door.sys
      then execute /bbs/c-drive/bre/start-bre [nodenumber]

   10) Done!

NOTE:
Always always _ALWAYS_ chown all the datafiles to the user the BBS runs at
or you'll get some unexpected errors.

DayDream will warn if it can't drop the dropfile, and most doors won't work
if they can't access the datafiles, so if your door isn't working -- check
the permissions on them first.


NOTE:
This patch adds two things to your config -- SYSOPFIRST and SYSOPLAST.
SYSOPFIRST is the sysops first name, and SYSOPLAST is the sysops last name.
ddcfg will complain if you do not have them in your config file.
